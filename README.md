# hello-world
This repository is for practicing the flow of GitHub. 

My name is Kenneth Rosario Rodriguez. I'm 30 years old and a previous Software Developer with experience in creating scalable and secure web apps with tools like Java (Spring Boot), Angular, and many others. 

This will be my university-focused repository, where I will showcase a myriad of projects to showcase my growth as a Data Scientist. 

Welcome to my journey as a Data Scientist!
